# The HTML Structure:
![page stru](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad_Pasha8/publication/323869270/figure/fig3/AS:606182121164801@1521536488788/Structure-of-an-HTML5-Web-Page.png)
 
 The html element basically tells your computer that this is an HTML document. All other element tags are 'nested' within the start and end html tags. The web page is then further subdivided into two main sections which are the 'head' and the 'body'.

The head section begins with the <head> start tag and terminates with the </head> end tag. Immediately following this comes the <body> start tag and just before the html end tag comes the </body> end tag.

There is only one set of <html>...</html> tags, one set of <head>...</head> tags and one set of <body>...</body> tags.

*The head section or document head has little content and mostly contains HTML coded instructions on how to title, categorize and 'run' the web page. The body section or document body on the other hand contains almost all of the content that you will put on your web page and this content —usually text but can also be pictures and sounds— is formatted using more HTML code. All text that you place outside of any angle brackets will become 'visible text' and will be displayed by your web browser on your web page. By placing that text in between the start and end tags of certain HTML elements, you can instruct a web browser where and how to display that text.*

# Adding Content to your Web Page
Now to add some content to your web page all you have to do is type some text in between the <body>...</body> tags. So let's, for example, put the words 'HELLO WORLD!' on your web page.
